# Colour Contrast Analyser

The Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA) helps you determine the legibility of text and the contrast of visual elements, such as graphical controls and visual indicators.

This repository contains the source code for the new Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA) builds for Windows and MacOS based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/). For the previous, non-Electron versions ("CCA Classic"), see the [CCA-Win](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/CCA-Win) and [CCA-OSX](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/CCA-OSX) repositories.
